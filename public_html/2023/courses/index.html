<p>During the last decade there have been significant advances in the construction of quantum computers. It is reaching the point of having the first quantum processors (QPU) capable of addressing problems of a certain magnitude. The first computer with 400 qbits has recently been announced and the launch of a 1000 qbits computer has been announced for 2023. These advances have motivated that the discipline of Quantum Programming, which had remained latent for several decades, is now gaining relevance day by day.</p>

<p>The success of Quantum Computing systems will depend not only on having powerful QPUs but also on the fact that software engineers are able to develop quantum software components and integrate them into classical systems. However, it is common for software engineers who try to approach the field of Quantum Computing to find great difficulty in doing so. Some of the reasons for this are as follows. On the one hand, the programming model based on quantum circuits that integrate quantum gates is of a very low abstraction level. This forces software developers to approach the theory of quantum information and the mathematical bases of quantum mechanics, which requires a great effort. On the other hand, Software Engineers usually try to approach quantum software development from the same perspective they are used to. However, the principles of Quantum Computing are very different from those of classical computing. Realising on that and understanding the differences is an additional gap that is difficult to bridge.</p>

<p>This course aims to help software engineers to address the aforementioned difficulties. The course introduces basic concepts of Quantum Computing and quickly goes on to show the structure of a quantum program and the main techniques and patterns used to develop them. Likewise, the integration of a quantum programs in classical software systems is also addressed. All the above is done from a practical perspective.</p>
